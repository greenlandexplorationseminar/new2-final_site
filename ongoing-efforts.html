									<h1>Ongoing Efforts</h1>
									<p>Current research projects and collaborative initiatives advancing the understanding of landslide risks in Greenland</p>
								</header>

								<p>Although climate change is rapidly accelerating permafrost thaw and deglaciation, thus increasing the risk of landslides, there are not currently widespread landslide monitoring/screening and early warning systems in place throughout the country. However, there are a number of areas where work is currently being done to remedy this lack of data and understanding of landslides throughout Greenland.</p>

								<p>Until recently, very little was known about the history and geographic distribution of landslides within Greenland. In 2019, Kristian Svennevig undertook the first Greenland-wide mapping effort <sup>[1]</sup> of past landslides using pre-existing geological maps as well as remote-sensed data, the results of which are shown in the image below.</p>

								</div>

								<p>However, although this work has provided important insights, it is far from comprehensive. There are numerous challenges that arise in such an endeavour. Firstly, pre-existing data on past landslides (before the arrival of remote-sensed data) is quite sparse, and is likely biased towards areas of Greenland that are closer to population centers and easier to access. Additionally, many landslide sites in Greenland are at least partially submerged below sea level, requiring more detailed bathymetric data than currently available for remote analysis. According to Svennevig "This is especially the case for the Precambrian basement-dominated parts of West and South-East Greenland, where slide scarps are often difficult to identify as they are controlled by local foliation and fracture patterns." <sup>[1]</sup> Often, there is a need to validate remote-sensed data with field observations (or to obtain more in-depth data, such as samples for dating the age of the landslide or to classify its type), but the cost and effort associated with field work in remote parts of Greenland is preventatively high.</p>

								<p>Other work has been done more recently to expand upon this work, much of it drawing from algorithmic time-series analysis on <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=4334ffd98a0a4be685f81157a6fbdeca" target="_blank">Arctic DEM</a> (Digital Elevation Model) data, which has 2-meter resolution for all of Greenland. <sup>[2]</sup></p>

								<p>Much like mapping efforts, live monitoring and early warning systems for landslides pose their own challenges. Much of the leading work in the area has been done by the Department of Geology within the Greenlandic government, with a specific focus on the Karrat Fjord system. This specific region is essentially being used as a test bed for monitoring systems, with the goal of gaining "a better understanding of the sliding dynamics [of landslides, as well as] to allow a quantitative risk assessment. The second objective is to test the feasibility of developing the systems into an early warning and/or an alarm system." <sup>[4]</sup></p>

								<p>Since 2022, the Greenlandic geologists have conducted extensive field work in the fjord system and have established two active monitoring systems, one at Kangerluarsuk in 2023 and Umiammakku Nunaat in 2022 (<a href="case-studies.html#karrat-2017">the site of a large 2017 landslide</a>). See a map of the monitoring systems below and click <a href="https://govmin.gl/landslides/current-assessment/" target="_blank">here</a> to view live footage from the Umiammakku Nunaat monitoring system.</p>

								</div>

								<p>The preliminary results from these monitoring systems are summarized in a <a href="https://govmin.gl/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Rapport-om-opdaterede-fjeldskredscenarier-tsunamiopskyl-og-risikovurderinger-June-2024-EN.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> by the Department of Geology.</p>

								<p>"After one year of operation (8 months in Kangerluarsuk), the first goal [of getting better data and understanding on landslide dynamics] has been met as the measurements allowed to refine previous landslide scenarios, now with significantly less uncertainty." <sup>[4]</sup> This is especially evidenced by the discovery of another high-risk instability in a cliff just east of the <a href="case-studies.html#karrat-2017">2017 landslide</a> called Umiammakku Nunaat Kangilleq, which was assessed to be the highest risk potential landslide of all the sites monitored in the area. Current work is being done to further analyze the risk of this potential landslide, as well as to develop an early-warning system for impacted communities in the area.</p>

								<p>Some of the challenges associated with implementing a warning system are enumerated in the report: "Operational warning and alarm systems must be accurate, reliable, efficient, and durable in operation. For example, redundant and physically independent measurements and procedures, based on well calibrated thresholds should allow for warning/alarming despite no-risk events or occasional malfunctions. These criteria are currently fulfilled only to a limited extent. In fact, most of the data are streamed with a time-lag of several minutes to hours. This is mainly due to the high-power consumption of the V-Sat antenna in Umiammakku Nunaat. If the connection fails, the system cannot switch to another communication system and monitoring is interrupted. It happens regularly that the V-Sat connection is interrupted due to bad weather in Nuuk.</p>

								<p>Some of these issues can be technically solved but can be very costly due to the remote locations without mobile coverage, challenging power supplies under winter conditions. In collaboration with Tusass [a Greenlandic telecommunications company], the Landslide group continuously keep up to date with technical developments in communication systems with a focus on ensuring the most cost-effective development. With the current knowledge and existing infrastructure, it is possible to initiate a phased approached risk assessment that focuses on early detection of anomalies." <sup>[4]</sup></p>

								<p>As part of this project, the potential <a href="landslide-science.html#tsunami">tsunami</a> risk to communities around the fjord system was also analyzed.</p>

								</div>

								<p>The image above, for example, shows that there is a high probability a majority of the inhabitants of the community of Nuugaatsiaq would be affected by a tsunami resulting from a landslide at Umiammakku Nunaat Kangilleq. This, along with other tsunami modeling found in the <a href="https://govmin.gl/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Rapport-om-opdaterede-fjeldskredscenarier-tsunamiopskyl-og-risikovurderinger-June-2024-EN.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>, highlights the urgent need for warning system development, both within the area and across other at-risk communities throughout Greenland. The goal is to iterate upon these monitoring systems and develop effective warning systems which can be scaled up to encompass larger areas of the country, but progress is unfortunately quite slow.</p>
