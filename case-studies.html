									<h2>Karrat Fjord (2017)</h2>
									<h3>71°38'33.51" N, 52°15'57.90" W</h3>
									
									<p>The steep, south facing slope of Ummiammakku Mountain overlooks the Karrat Fjord. On June 17, 2017, 58 million cubic meters of rock was dumped into the water below. This created a <a href="landslide-science.html#tsunami">tsunami</a> with an initial wave height of 100 meters. By the time waves reached the village Nuugaatsiaq, which was 30 km south of the initial landslide, they were around 9 meters tall. This caused 4 casualties and extensive property damage. Illorlisat, another nearby village, was also impacted by the tsunami. Many residents had to resettle somewhere else. As of 2020, both villages are abandoned settlements because Greenland's Public Safety Commission declared them as dangerous zones.</p>

									<p>There were at least two minor avalanches leading up to the one in 2017. They were both to the east of the 2017 event, with one being in 2009 and one in 2016. However, because of the remote location of Ummiammakku Mountain, signs of these minor landslides were only recorded after the major one. There are also signs suggesting that the area had previously seen a lot of landslide activity in ancient times, until the region became stable for an extended period of time.</p>

									</div>
									
									<p>All of the landslides around Karrat Fjord are thought to be caused by <a href="landslide-science.html#dip-slope-failure">dip-slope failure</a>. This is due to the geological structure of the area around Karrat Fjord. The original layering of rocks in this region is thought to be in the same direction as the slope of the mountain, which allows rocks to slide more easily along one another. Coupled with the formation of cracks in the rocks running parallel to the coastline, this region is predisposed to being unstable.</p>
									
									<p>Now that average air temperatures in the area have risen above the melting point for permafrost, the landslide activity has emerged. Permafrost was helping the otherwise unstable slope hold itself together. As global temperatures continue to rise due to climate change, it is thought that this region will become more unstable and see increased landslide activity.</p>

									<h2>Niiortuut (1952)</h2>
									<h3>70°20'56.4" N, 53°10'40.8" W</h3>
									
									<p>On December 15, 1952, 5.9 million cubic meters of degraded permafrozen talus collapsed in a landslide near the Niiortuut mountain on the south coast of the Nuussuaq Peninsula, and up to 76% of this material fell into the ocean. This resulted in a <a href="landslide-science.html#tsunami">tsunami</a> that killed a fisherman in southern Nuussuaq, a village 10 km away from where the landslide occurred. The tsunami also caused property damage in Qullissat, a now abandoned mining town located 30 km south of the landslide.</p>
									
									<p>Permafrost degradation was found to be a major factor in the conditions that allowed the landslide to occur. This event is the first historically documented instance of melting permafrost generating a landslide-tsunami in the Arctic, and as Arctic slopes continue to degrade, events like this will become more frequent.</p>
									
									<p>Although little is known about the circumstances that caused this landslide, it has been used as a model to potentially detect future landslides.</p>

									<h2>Paatuut (1996, 2000)</h2>
									<h3>70°16'00.0" N, 52°45'00.0" W</h3>
									
									<h4>1996 Landslide</h4>
									<p>The 1996 Paatuut Landslide did not cause a significant enough impact to be documented at the time, but some residents of the Saqqaq fishing village, 40 km south east of the landslide area, reported seeing waves that were more extreme than usual. This event also produced a <a href="landslide-science.html#tsunami">tsunami</a>, with a maximum wave height of 15 m. This tsunami is significantly smaller than the one produced by the landslide in 2000. Scientists think about 55 million cubic meters of material was displaced in this landslide.</p>
									
									<p>The 1996 landslide was discovered by scientists investigating the 2000 landslide. They saw that the slope was covered with vegetation in satellite images from before 1996, but that this suddenly disappeared around the middle of the summer that year. From this, scientists determined the ground must have been disrupted by some event. In imagery dating back to 1988, a large fracture can be seen in the slope. It is thought that this crack continued to grow, eventually leading to this landslide.</p>
									
									<p>The landslide that occurred in 2000 erased nearly all evidence of the 1996 landslide that was left behind on the slope. The only remaining evidence of the 1996 landslide exists on the western coast of the region. Some <a href="landslide-science.html#molard">molards</a> and other signs of debris still exist there and cannot be attributed to the 2000 landslide. Based on the presence of <a href="landslide-science.html#molard">molards</a>, scientists think large chunks of permafrost cemented talus moved down the slope in this avalanche.</p>
									
									<p>The 1996 landslide moved these boulders of permafrost towards the coast. As they sat above ground, they melted. These boulders are thought to have completely melted by 2000, leaving behind loose material. The 2000 landslide was able to pick up this loose material. The 1996 landslide also primed the ground for the 2000 landslide by smoothing and reducing the friction of the slope. Both of these factors led to the 2000 landslide creating a much bigger tsunami upon impacting the Vaigat Straight.</p>
									
									<h4>2000 Landslide</h4>
									<p>The Paatuut landslide on November 21, 2000 resulted in 60 million cubic meters of rock sliding down a slope. Around 1/3 of this material ended up in the Vaigat Strait, creating a <a href="landslide-science.html#tsunami">tsunami</a> with an initial wave height of 50 m. The people of Saqqaq, the nearest inhabited village, saw extreme waves from around 40km south east of where the material entered the water.</p>
									
									<p>The Paatuut region is known for being geologically unstable. Dense rocks lay on top of loose sediments, making the region prone to rockslides. These sediments are typically held in place by permafrost, but with rising global temperatures, they are more loose than ever. The previous Paatuut landslide in 1996 is thought to have loosened some ground, which then shifted even more resulting in the more extreme landslide in 2000. Whereas the 1996 landslide is thought to have contained chunks of permafrost, the 2000 landslide is thought to have been composed almost entirely of bedrock.</p>
									
									<p>Weather conditions in the days leading up to the event in 2000 likely triggered the event. About a week before, snow covered a steep slope. Next, a warm wind passed by and melted the snow. Melt water found its way into cracks in the rocks of the slope. In the days right before the landslide, the slope became very cold again. The cold temperatures and chilling effect from underground permafrost allowed this melt water to freeze again. As water freezes, it expands. The cracks in the rocks were forced to become bigger as the water in them froze, which broke apart rocks and caused the dramatic slide.</p>

									<h2>Assapaat (2021)</h2>
									<h3>70°19'08.89" N, 52°59'48.06" W</h3>
									
									<p>On June 13, 2021, there was a large avalanche of frozen debris near Assapaat on the Nuussuaq Peninsula. A crack in the slope ruptured and released 25.9 million cubic meters of material in two back-to-back landslides. The first flattened the slope near the shore, so debris entered the Vaigat Straight at a relatively slow speed. This low speed meant there was no resulting <a href="landslide-science.html#tsunami">tsunami</a>, which is unusual for landslides in this area.</p>
									
									<p>The cracks in the slope that caused this landslide were first spotted by helicopter images from two years before the incident. The ability to identify this weakness before the event is evidence of improving early warning systems.</p>
									
									<p>Like other landslides in this area, the 2021 Assapaat landslide is thought to be connected to melting permafrost. The slope is composed of permafrost soils. As the underlying permafrost melts, the debris on top of it becomes more mobile, resulting in landslide events. As temperatures continue to rise, permafrost will continue to melt, and there will be more events like this one.</p>

								<section id="dickson-2023">
									<h2>Dickson Fjord (2023)</h2>
									<h3>72°81'7" N, 26°96'5" W</h3>
									
									<p>The Hisinger glacier dead-ends in the Dickson Fjord. As temperatures on the east coast of Greenland have been rising, the glacier has started to melt and thin. On September 16, 2023, this had devastating consequences. Part of the glacier upheld a pile of rocks directly above the water. Eventually, this ice thinned enough that the pressure of the rock on top of it caused it to break. 27.2 million cubic meters of rock and ice were plunged into the water below. The resulting <a href="landslide-science.html#tsunami">tsunami</a> had wave heights up to 110 m.</p>
									
									<p>Luckily, this landslide and tsunami had no casualties. Although the tsunami was strong enough to capsize small boats, no one was in the area at the time. The tsunami did cause substantial property damage, though. At Nanok Station, 72 km away from the landslide, the tsunami's wave height was 4 m.</p>
									
									<p>This landslide was unique because it created a seismic signal that could be observed worldwide for 9 days. This is because the landslide created a seiche in the fjord. A seiche occurs when water sloshes back and forth. In this case, the movement back and forth completed its cycle around every 90 seconds, and lost its energy very slowly, which created such a strong signal.</p>
									
									<p>Glaciers across Greenland are starting to melt away as the climate warms. With increased warming, there is increased loss of glaciers. Some of these glaciers are important support systems for their nearby landscapes. As global warming continues, we can expect to see more landslides like the one in Dickson Fjord.</p>
