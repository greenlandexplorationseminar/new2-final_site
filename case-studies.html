									<h2>Karrat Fjord (2017)</h2>
									<h3>71°38'33.51" N, 52°15'57.90" W</h3>

									<p>The steep, south facing slope of Ummiammakku Mountain overlooks the Karrat Fjord. On June 17, 2017, 58 million cubic meters of rock was dumped into the water below. This created a <a href="landslide-science.html#tsunami">tsunami</a> with an initial wave height of 100 meters. By the time waves reached the village Nuugaatsiaq, which was 30 km south of the initial landslide, they were around 9 meters tall. This caused 4 casualties and extensive property damage. Illorlisat, another nearby village, was also impacted by the tsunami. Many residents had to resettle somewhere else. As of 2020, both villages are abandoned settlements because Greenland's Public Safety Commission declared them as dangerous zones.</p>
									
									<p>There were at least two minor avalanches leading up to the one in 2017. They were both to the east of the 2017 event, with one being in 2009 and one in 2016. However, because of the remote location of Ummiammakku Mountain, signs of these minor landslides were only recorded after the major one. There are also signs suggesting that the area had previously seen a lot of landslide activity in ancient times, until the region became stable for an extended period of time.</p>
									
									<p>All of the landslides around Karrat Fjord are thought to be caused by <a href="landslide-science.html#dip-slope-failure">dip-slope failure</a>. This is due to the geological structure of the area around Karrat Fjord. The original layering of rocks in this region is thought to be in the same direction as the slope of the mountain, which allows rocks to slide more easily along one another. Coupled with the formation of cracks in the rocks running parallel to the coastline, this region is predisposed to being unstable.</p>
									
									<p>Now that average air temperatures in the area have risen above the melting point for permafrost, the landslide activity has emerged. Permafrost was helping the otherwise unstable slope hold itself together. As global temperatures continue to rise due to climate change, it is thought that this region will become more unstable and see increased landslide activity.</p>
